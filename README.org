#+TITLE: emacs snap

*work-in-progress* (or rather *on-hold*)

This is my attempt to build emacs 26.1 snap, as there is no package or popular
repository for this version for ubuntu 18.10 (as of this writing).

The attempt is paused though, because:

- To build a snap, you need ubuntu 16.04 (and we have 18.10).
- You can work around by using docker or LXD or a VM with 16.04.
- I've tried docker ([[https://github.com/igor-kupczynski/snapcraft-docker][and it went quite well]]), but then it turned out that docker
  can't build emacs (this is not a joke, you can't build emacs in a docker
  container without some hacks, check
  https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/22801).
  
I'm parking that for now, until I find few hours to research LXD builds.
